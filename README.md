UCAIR3D  
Utah Center for Advanced Imaging Research (UCAIR) 3D Medical Image Viewer  
Python-based tool for interactively displaying 3D medical images   

- overlay of multiple layers in the viewport
- select from a list of colormaps
- display continuous or discrete data
- interactively:  
    - scroll through slices
    - zoom and pan
    - add and manipulate markers
    - paint on the image
    - adjust windowing and opacity

UCAIR3D consists of multiple, individual classes. It is not a stand-alone application and there is no main window. These
classes are intended to be shared by other viewport-based applications.
